# orbmech

**orbmech** is a Python package for simulating and analyzing orbital mechanics. It provides tools for simulating an object's orbit, classifying the type of orbit based on its eccentricity, and visualizing the orbital path. This package is useful for anyone interested in orbital dynamics, astronomy, or space exploration.

## Features

- Simulate the orbit of an object given its initial conditions.
- Classify the orbit type based on its eccentricity (circular, elliptical, hyperbolic, or parabolic).
- Plot the orbital path using `matplotlib`.
- Provides both summary output (first 5 values) and full simulation data.
